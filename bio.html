				<h2>From Humble Beginnings</h2>
				<p>Jon was born at Sibley Hospital in Bethesda, MD. At the age of five he was given his
				first pair of glasses. His first video game system was a Nintendo 64, acquired at the
				age of eight. He attended elementary school, and then middle school, and then high school.
				He survived all three of these schools.</p>
				<h2>A Journey Quest</h2>
				<p>Jon arrived at Tufts University in the Autumn of 2010. Since then he has made many friends
				and has maintained membership in several clubs. He is a radio DJ once a week.</p>
				<h2>The Future?</h2>
				<p>Jon's future is unclear, as no man can peer into the Sands of Time. To attempt to extrapolate
				a life's path from such a premature and fixed state would not only be foolhardy but an 
				affront to God and nature.
