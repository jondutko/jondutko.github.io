Education
	Tufts University – Medford, MA								June 2014
		Bachelor of Arts, Computer Science, Minor in English
	Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School – Bethesda, MD					May 2010

Technical Skills
	Fluent in C (and many of its dialects), Java, Ruby and Python. Well-versed in assembly language programming, machine structure, operating systems, and conventional data structures. Working knowledge of an array of functional languages (Scheme, ML, Haskell). Familiar with the fundamentals of web programming, specifically JavaScript. Comfortable with the regression cycle of quality assurance in the video game industry, specifically on the SmartBear and JIRA platforms. At home with the Microsoft Office suite of productivity software (word processing, spreadsheet management, etc.). 

Work Experience
	Quality Assurance, Bethesda Softworks (Rockville, MD)				Summers 2013/2011
Worked as a contractor in 2011 in the testing of Brink, Rage and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, where I learned to work within the developer-QA regression cycle.  Invited back to work on The Elder Scrolls Online in 2013, where I performed and helped to coordinate dungeon checks and translated my prior QA experience into work in an MMO setting.
	Guest Researcher, National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD)	2009/2010
		Fulfilled a guest research position in NIST’s Intelligent Systems Division. Under the purview of Dr. Stephen Balakirsky and working with fellow researcher Taylor Brent, developed a virtual environment generator in order to test prototypical urban search and rescue robotics technology. Worked with Unreal Tournament script on the backend and Java on the frontend. Relevant wiki and source code are available online.
	Intern, Activate (Dupont Circle, Washington, DC)						Summer 2008
Played a hands-on role in the foundation and early development of political telecom startup Activate under president and owner Mark Sump. Spent the first half of the summer in formation of the physical workspace: assembling furniture, setting up wireless networks, and constructing individual workstations. The second half of the summer was spent canvassing congressional offices and otherwise political organizations, and learning the lessons that only come with cold-calling salesmanship.
